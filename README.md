# tutedude_assignments
This Repository is created to store the assignments done as part courses taken from tutedude

For each assignment, a new folder will be created like ASSIGNMENT_01, ASSIGNMENT_02 and each folder will contain a separate .py file for each task under respective assignment.

I will add a README.md in each folder, so that it will be easy for evaluation.
